echo You should run make_hybridcd from there.

echo Also build regular Boot-CDs and Live-CDs first, and create a directory
echo "hybridcd_extras" (inside the reactos folder). Put everything else
echo that should go in the CD root into that directory.

echo You also need to put a version of "mkisofs.exe" into the reactos

echo Our cdmake doesn't support creating an ISO9660:1999 filesystem, which is
