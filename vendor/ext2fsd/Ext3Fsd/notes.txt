==================================
Release Notes for Ext2Fsd V0.46
==================================

Modifications from V0.45:

    1, ext3 journal check and replay implemented. If the journal is
       not empty ext2fsd will replay the journal and make the file
       system consistent as an ext2 file system.

    2, flexible-inode-size supported. recent Linux are using 256-byte
       inode that fails 0.45 and before to show all the files.

    3, FIXME: 2 minor issues that mislead EditPlus. EditPlus is always
       trying to open any file with directory_only flag set to judge
       whether the target is a directory or file, when the file isn't
       a directory, the open request should be denied. But Ext2Fsd 0.45
       and before doesn't. Another issue is that ext2 file time on disk
       has different precision against windows (1 second vs 100 nano
       second), which causes EditPlus thinks the file is being changed.

    4, FIXME: a severe bug (likely happen on win2k system) which cause
       dirty caches missed and slow down the whole system. 

    5, many other minor changes: bulk block allocation/release, possible
       inode allocation dead-loop when all inodes are used out, Ext2Mgr
       win2k support, other performance improvements.

Features to be implemented in future:

    1, LVM support
    2, Documents improvement: clear and elaborate
    3, Performance improvement, code optimization
    4, EXT3 features support (htree, journal)
    5, Automatic check & update of new versions

    Since 0.38, Ext2fsd is much stable even under heavy i/o loads,
    both for reading and writing. Performance and stability are
    highly, improved especially stability. A new and strong era of
    Ext2Fsd in product shape is coming :)

WARNINGS:
 
    The driver may crash your system and ruin your data unexpectedly,
    since there might be software conflicts and I could only test it
    on some of the popular platforms. You should use it with care and
    use it at your own risk!
