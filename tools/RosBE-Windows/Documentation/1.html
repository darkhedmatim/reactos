1. First of all, lets answer the main question: What is RosBE?
Its a
Environment for building ReactOS on your own, its based on GCC 4.1.3
Compiler and aims for absolute Beginners and skilled devs. This of
course it quite difficult. How, as an example, do you tell a newbie how
to use SVN or maintain/update a Source tree? Easy. This package has the
typical, well know SVN for all advanced devs and a slim Version
specially made for newbies, called ssvn (Simple SVN), which only does
the main stuff and has no difficult to understand or even dangerous, if
wrong used, functions. This is justthe beginning of a big list of
features. Devs will be happy with the included GDB.
