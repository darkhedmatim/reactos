<dl>
  <dt>make</dt>
  <dd>Usage: make [OPTIONS]<br>
  </dd>
  <dd> The command to build the ReactOS Source Tree in the Default
directory.<br>
Without options it does a standard build of ReactOS. OPTIONS are the
standard ReactOS build options ie. </dd>
  <dd>
    <ul>
      <li>bootcd</li>
      <li>livecd</li>
      <li>etc.</li>
    </ul>
  </dd>
  <dt>makex</dt>
  <dd>Usage: makex [OPTIONS]<br>
  </dd>
  <dd> Same as 'make' but automatically determines the number of CPU
Cores in your system and uses "make -j x" with the appropriate number
to threaden the build process for a massive speedup on Multi Core
Systems.<br>
NOTE: The number makex uses can be modified by editing Build-Multi.cmd
located in the RosBE directory, instructions for doing so are contained
within the file.</dd>
  <dt>basedir</dt>
  <dd>Usage: basedir</dd>
  <dd>Switches back to the ReactOS source directory.</dd>
  <dt>chdefdir</dt>
  <dd>Usage: chdefdir [OPTIONS]</dd>
  <dd> Reconfigures the Default Source Folder for one Session. This is
useful for switching between branches or different ReactOS Source
Trees. Exiting RosBE sets back to the Default. </dd>
  <dd>
    <ul>
      <li> <dfn>default</dfn> - Sets back to the Default Source Folder
without a restart of RosBE.</li>
    </ul>
  </dd>
  <dt>clean</dt>
  <dd>Usage: clean [logs]</dd>
  <dd> Fully cleans the ReactOS source directory and does a better job
than "make clean" does.<br>
It deletes files, which are being generated into the Source Tree while
compiling. After using this Command the tree is completely cleaned up
and 1:1 like a fresh loaded one. </dd>
  <dd>
    <ul>
      <li> <dfn>logs</dfn> - Removes all build logs in the RosBE-Logs
directory. </li>
    </ul>
  </dd>
  <dt>config</dt>
  <dd>Usage: config [OPTIONS]</dd>
  <dd> This Command creates a Configuration File, which tells RosBE how
to build the Tree. There are many things you can modify in the build
process and this tool can edit all for you. ISOs made with a non
default are NOT usable to file bugs in any way! </dd>
  <dd>
    <ul>
      <li> <dfn>delete</dfn> - Deletes the created configuration File
and so sets back to default settings. </li>
    </ul>
  </dd>
  <dt>help</dt>
  <dd>Usage: help [COMMAND]</dd>
  <dd> Shows help for the specified command or lists all available
commands.</dd>
  <dt>options</dt>
  <dd>Usage: options</dd>
  <dd> Starts the RosBE Configuration Program.<br>
  </dd>
  <dt>raddr2line</dt>
  <dd>Usage: raddr2line [OPTIONS]</dd>
  <dd> This Command translates program addresses of BSODs into file
names and line numbers of the Code it was built of to assist Developers
to find specific Bugs in ReactOS. This Tool is mainly a Dev Tool.
Newbies normally only need it if a devs wants them to try out
something. </dd>
  <dd>
    <ul>
      <li> <dfn>first parameter</dfn> - has to be the Executable to be
analyzed. </li>
      <li> <dfn>second parameter</dfn> - has to be the address to be
translated. If you don't set the needed Parameters, you will be asked
for them. </li>
    </ul>
  </dd>
  <dt>scut</dt>
  <dd>Usage: scut [OPTIONS]</dd>
  <dd>Defines, Edits, Removes, Switches and Defaults to Shortcutted
Source Directories. scut started without a parameter or with the name
of a Shortcut as parameter sets this Shortcut active. </dd>
  <dd>
    <ul>
      <li> <dfn>add</dfn> - Adds a Shortcut to a sourcecode. </li>
      <li> <dfn>rem</dfn> - Deletes a specific shortcut. </li>
      <li> <dfn>edit</dfn> - Lets you edit a specific shortcut. </li>
      <li> <dfn>def</dfn> - Chooses Default Shortcut which is enabled
one every start of RosBE. "Default" is the Source Directory as you know
it from previous Versions. </li>
    </ul>
  </dd>
  <dt>ssvn</dt>
  <dd>Usage: ssvn [OPTIONS]</dd>
  <dd> This is the simple to use sSVN, written for newbies. It only
Creates, Updates or cleans up your ReactOS Source Tree or shows the
Revision Number of the Offline Tree and Online HEAD Revision to see if
its up to date. No need for any additional parameters, just "ssvn
update" and your Tree is fully updated. </dd>
  <dd>
    <ul>
      <li> <dfn>update</dfn> - Updates to HEAD Revision or to a
specific one when second parameter specifies one. </li>
      <li> <dfn>create</dfn> - Creates a new ReactOS Source Tree and
got some Security Features. It checks if the folder is empty, contains
a Source Tree or any other files and Cancels if continuing is unsecure.
      </li>
      <li> <dfn>cleanup</dfn> - Cleans up and fixes errors in the
Source Tree. It is mainly needed if the "ssvn update" or "ssvn create"
command got aborted in any way or show problems like error messages
etc. </li>
      <li> <dfn>status</dfn> - Shows Actual offline Revision Number
and online HEAD Revision Number to see if its up to date. </li>
    </ul>
  </dd>
