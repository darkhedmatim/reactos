Tasks to do by the end of GSoC (sorted in decending order by importance):

1) Make sure all basic functinalities are working
	- accept so far is not which should be fixed


2) 	Create a test application that simulates heavy usage
   of networking. Preferably multi threaded. This should
   check whether we have any memory leaks, broken functionality
   or fatal blue screen errors.

3) 	Improve existing IOCTLs.
4)	Improve support for netstat (e.g. netstat -na).

Notes:

	- 2) Worth looking into how we can take advantage of firefox's
stress tests (e.g. xmlhttprequest)

	- 1) 2) and a bit of 3) should be completed before the midterm
evaluations.
