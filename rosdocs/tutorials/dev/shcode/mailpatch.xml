<title>Test your patch</title>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>Thoroughly check that your change works as intended.</listitem>
<listitem>Test your changes with the latest code from CVS. Something may have changed in the latest code that either breaks your change or causes your change to break something else.</listitem>
<listitem>Make sure that ReactOS can still boot and that any applications or systems that may be affected by your change still run properly.</listitem>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem>Make sure you have diff.exe on your system. If you don't, you can obtain it from <ulink url="http://www.cygwin.com/">http://www.cygwin.com/</ulink>, click on their "Install Cygwin now" link (diff can be found under the Base category).</listitem>
<listitem>You must have both the old version of the file, and your new modified version to make the diff.</listitem>
<listitem>To create the diff file:
<programlisting>
diff.exe file1 file2 > mypatch.dif
</programlisting>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
</listitem>
<listitem>Zip all new files and diffs to existing files and send them to the person that will commit the changes to CVS.</listitem>
