I wrote some inline wide character string functions. It are modified version
of the ones in string.h. I added four more function nl stricmp, strnicmp,
wcsicmp, and wcsnicmp. These are the case insensitive variants of
strcmp, strncmp and wcscmp, wcsncmp. I tested all the functions but I
would urge anyone to tested again. I removed an extern specifier
__wcstok and strtok cause I it caused an compilation error when
using strtok or wcstok. Please could someone see if this correct.
I also used these string functions in lstring api functions.
