/me bows humbly and begs %s's forgiveness
%s is soo cool... I hope to be like him some day
/me hides in a corner and hopes %s doesn't beat him with the whipping noodle again
/me prostrates at %s's feet and begs his majesty's forgiveness
%s: please don't hurt me!
I'm not worthy... I'm not worthy...
/me sings %s's praises to the world!
/me thinks %s is smarter than %dev%
%s: oh please may I defrag your sock drawer?
/me gives %s a cookie, hoping it will make up for breaking %func% the other day...
