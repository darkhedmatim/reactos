This document describes the state of a uniprocessor PC at each of the IRQ
levels supported by the ReactOS kernel

PASSIVE_LEVEL:    IF bit clear in the processor flags
                  All irqs umasked at the PIC
	
APC_LEVEL: Unknown
WAKE_LEVEL: Unknown
	
DISPATCH_LEVEL:   IF bit clear in the processor flags
                  All irqs umasked at the PIC
		  Thread dispatching disabled
		  
DIRQL (Device specific IRQ level):     
          IF bit clear in the processor flags
          Device's irq and all lower priority irqs masked at the PIC
	  Thread dispatching disabled
                                
HIGH_LEVEL:       IF bit set in the processor flags
                  All irqs masked at the PIC
		  Thread dispatching disabled
