1. What is RosCMS?

   RosCMS, the abbreviation of ReactOS Content Management System, 
is an an Open Source effort to develop a Web Content Management
System that is simple, fast and can generate static web pages.

   The RosCMS project, although currently coded for the ReactOS
Website, is a powerful CMS for areas where speed, simplicity and
stability are needed.

   Version 3 features an new user interface which improves the
overall workflow experience. RosCMS v3 uses asynchronous
data loading (XML streams). The AJAX features have been
implemented with security in mind and as a consequence RosCMS 
uses xml streams instead of infamous JSON. In contrary to other
AJAX alike software, RosCMS don't rely on hacks like hidden 
(i)frames but on industrial standard which works in almost all
browsers. The advantage is that RosCMS works fine in IE, Mozilla,
Opera, Safari and some more browsers.
