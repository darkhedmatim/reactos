 *               cpu_buffer  : The memory buffer we have our binary code that we whant convert
 *               cpu_pos     : Current positions in the cpu_buffer 
 *               cpu_size    : The memory size of the cpu_buffer
 *               BaseAddress : The base address you whant the binay file should run from 
 *               cpuarch     : if it exists diffent cpu from a manufactor like pentium,
 *                             pentinum-mmx so on, use this flag to specify which type 
 *                             of cpu you whant or do not use it if it does not exists
 *                             other or any sub model.
 *
 *                mode       : if we should run disambler of this binary or
 *                             translate it, Disambler will not calc the
 *                             the row name right so we simple give each
                               row a name. In translations mode we run a 
 *                             analys so we getting better optimzing and 
 *                             only row name there we need.
 *                             value for mode are :
 *                                                  0 = disambler mode
 *                                                  1 = translate mode intel
 *
 * Return value :
 *               value -1            : unimplement 
 *               value  0            : wrong opcode or not vaild opcode
 *               value +1 and higher : who many byte we should add to cpu_pos
