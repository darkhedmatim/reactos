"make"<br>
Usage: make [OPTIONS1] [OPTIONS2]<br>
The command to build the ReactOS Source Tree in the Default directory.<br>
Without options it does a standard build of ReactOS. OPTIONS1 are the
standard ReactOS build options ie. "bootcd", "livecd", etc.<br>
"strip" as optional second parameter sets stripping to enabled and thus
reduces File Size by ~30% and Minimum needed RAM to use ReactOS to ~24
MB. ISOs built with this command are NOT usable to file bugs in any way!<br>
<br>
"makex"<br>
Usage: makex [OPTIONS1] [OPTIONS2]<br>
Same as 'make' but automatically determines the number of CPU Cores in
your system and uses "make -j x" with the appropriate number to
threaden the build process for a massive speedup on Multi Core Systems.<br>
NOTE: The number makex uses can be modified by editing Build-Multi.cmd
located in the RosBE directory, instructions for doing so are contained
within the file. This Command is incompatible to Windows Vista right
now due to a bug in GCC 4.X.X.<br>
<br>
"clean"<br>
Usage: clean [logs]<br>
Fully cleans the ReactOS source directory and does a better job than
"make clean" does.<br>
It deletes files, which are being generated into the Source Tree while
compiling. After using this Command the tree is completely cleaned up
and 1:1 like a fresh loaded one.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; logs - Removes all build logs in the RosBE-Logs directory.<br>
<br>
"help"<br>
Usage: help [COMMAND]<br>
Shows help for the specified command or lists all available commands.<br>
<br>
"ssvn"<br>
Usage: ssvn [OPTIONS]<br>
This is the simple to use sSVN, written for newbies. It only Creates,
Updates or cleans up your ReactOS Source Tree or shows the Revision
Number of the Offline Tree and Online HEAD Revision to see if its up to
date. No need for any additional parameters, just "ssvn update" and
your Tree is fully updated.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; update&nbsp; - Updates to HEAD Revision or to a specific
one when second parameter specifies one.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; create&nbsp; - Creates a new ReactOS Source Tree and got
some Security Features. It
checks if the folder is empty, contains a Source Tree or any other
files and Cancels if continuing is unsecure.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; cleanup - Cleans up and fixes errors in the Source Tree.
It is mainly needed if the "ssvn update" or "ssvn create" command got
aborted in any way or show problems like error messages etc.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; status&nbsp; - Shows Actual offline Revision Number and
online HEAD Revision Number to see if its up to date.<br>
<br>
"chdefdir"<br>
Usage: chdefdir [OPTIONS]<br>
Reconfigures the Default Source Folder for one Session. This is useful
for switching between branches or different ReactOS Source Trees.
Exiting RosBE sets back to the Default.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; default - Sets back to the Default Source Folder without a
restart of RosBE.<br>
<br>
"config"<br>
Usage: config [OPTIONS]<br>
This Command creates a Configuration File, which tells RosBE how to
build the Tree. There are many things you can modify in the build
process and this tool can edit all for you. ISOs made with a non
default are NOT usable to file bugs in any way!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; delete - Deletes the created configuration File and so
sets back to default settings.<br>
<br>
"raddr2line"<br>
Usage: raddr2line [OPTIONS]<br>
This Command translates program addresses of BSODs into file names and
line numbers of the Code it was built of to assist Developers to find
specific Bugs in ReactOS. This Tool is mainly a Dev Tool. Newbies
normally only need it if a devs wants them to try out something.<br>
USAGE: The first parameter has to be the Executable to be analyzed. The
second one has to be the address to be translated. If you don't set the
needed Parameters, you will be asked for them.<br>
<br>
"basedir"<br>
Usage: basedir<br>
Switches back to the ReactOS source directory.
