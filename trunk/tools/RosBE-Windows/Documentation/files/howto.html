Q: How do I build ReactOS Source?<br>
A: Start RosBE and type "make bootcd" or "make livecd" to generate
ReactOS ISO Files from the Source.<br>
<br>
Q: I have a Multi Core CPU. Can I speed up the build process anyhow?<br>
A: Yes, you can. Just use makex instead of make Command. makex checks
for the Number of Cores and optimizes the Processes to that number.<br>
<br>
Q: How/Where can I get the Source Code?<br>
A: You could load it via any SVN Client from:
svn://svn.reactos.org/reactos/trunk/reactos RosBE itself has SVN
Command Line Client and a lite Variant for newbies called "ssvn"
(SimpleSVN) included. If you want to get the Source Tree, type "ssvn
create" and it copies all Code to the Default Source Folder you did set
while the Setup.<br>
<br>
Q: How can I update the Source Code?<br>
A: Just type "ssvn update".<br>
<br>
Q: Can I see somewhere if my Source Tree is up to date?<br>
A: Yes, just type "ssvn status".<br>
<br>
Q: My Source Tree is fucked up / Updating was aborted etc. etc. and now
I cannot update it anymore... What to do?<br>
A: You need to cleanup it. Type "ssvn cleanup" and wait. After that
type "ssvn update" and it runs again.<br>
