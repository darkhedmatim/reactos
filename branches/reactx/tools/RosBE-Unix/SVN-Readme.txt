Information
------------

This "RosBE-Unix" SVN directory is just for tracking changes in the script
files.
It does not contain a fully functional Build Environment as some packages are
missing in the "sources" directory.

You can download a full RosBE-Unix package from http://reactos.colinfinck.de
(later on it will be downloadable from the official ReactOS Website)
