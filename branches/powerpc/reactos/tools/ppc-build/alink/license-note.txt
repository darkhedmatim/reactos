I received permission from Anthony Williams to use alink as the basis for
the elf to coff conversion stage in reactos-powerpc.  Thanks to Anthony
for writing alink in a way that made it possible to produce binaries for
reactos-powerpc, and for giving me permission to modify it despite the
license.

This version of alink has been modified heavily, mostly for the benefit
of producing pe-coff powerpc executables.
