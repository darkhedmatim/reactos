This is a list of todos for win32k. If you found something that needs to be 
done, but you can't or don't want to handle it right now, you can add an entry
here, so it won't get forgotton.

Please also note, where to find the problem (file / function), and possible 
requirements before it can be handled.


# Lock the PDEV lock only when we are going to touch the PDEV or the Surface
  Currently the PDEV is locked (shared HSEM == ERESOURCE) when we lock the DC,
  this is only a minimal implementation, as we don't need to do that, when we
  don't even touch anything from the PDEV or the surface. This should be
  optimized. (see dc.h, DC_LockDc)

# Get rid of all float and double in win32k.
  We can't use the fpu on x86 in the kernel, as fpu state is not saved in
  user/kernel transitions. There are 3 possible solutions:
  1.) Rewrite the function to use integer (preferred)
  2.) Use FLOATOBJ
  3.) Use KeSaveFloatingPointState (slow, avoid!)

# Rewrite the handle manager! Once and for all!
