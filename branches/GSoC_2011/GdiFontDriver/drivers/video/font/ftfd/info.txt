Installation
========
To install the driver, copy it to your Windows\system32 folder. Then go the following registry key:
HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsodt\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Font Drivers
There should be at least one value: "Adobe Type Manager" : REG_SZ : "atmfd.dll"
Create a new value of type REG_SZ. The name is "Freetype Font driver", the value is "ftfd.dll"
Reboot.

Testing
=====
Since Windows uses an internal driver for TrueType fonts, build into win32k and loaded before any
other font driver, custom drivers will never see any ttf files. To test it, you can use OpenType fonts
in Adobe Type1 format. Those would usually be handled by the "Adobe Type Manager font driver" atmfd.dll.
But the newly installed driver will see the font file first.

Warning
======
The driver is not production quality, so expect crashes. Don't use it on your production machine, but in
a virtual machine. Attaching WinDbg to Windows is recommended to see the debug output. Or use DbgView
from SysInternals.
