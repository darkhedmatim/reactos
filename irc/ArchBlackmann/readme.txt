ArchBlackman is a IRC-Chat bot. He has been coded by Royce3 and currently DrFred (mbosma) runs him. 

If some one use a swear word he'll tell him not to do so. You can also ask him something technical about reactos. :)

He also knows some commands. You can give him one like this "ArchBlackmann: !grovel". (don't forget to address him)

* !grovel - This is the only command that non ops can do (No Parameter)
* !kiss <person>
* !hug <person>
* !give <someone> <something> 

* !add <list> <item>
* !remove <list> <item>

The lists are the same as the text files. Most of the lists are not used directly, but by the other lists. Like this:

  /me thinks %s is smarter than %dev%
